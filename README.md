In `implementations.py`, there are functions that should be implemented in this assignment, including 2D discrete Fourier transform and inverse transform, azimuthal averaging. Also, some other functions that needed for other implementations and data reading is included.

In `report.py`, the functions explicitly denote which task it is for. For example, `task1()` is for task1, implementing 2D discrete Fourier transform and applying `np.fft.fftshift()`. `show` argument is set to `True` by default, which is for showing the result image. To check image, use `show = True`. If you are iterating for list of images, set `show = False` to pass showing image.

`detect()` in `report.py` is not required in PA pdf, but it is implemented for making criterion for the classification.
